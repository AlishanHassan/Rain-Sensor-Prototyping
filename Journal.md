1. Decided to log stuff everyday, mostly as a way to keep notes. 
2. Ran the Photon overnight. Stability is questionable since it seems to lose the cloud connection from time to time. It did reconnect automatically, but we need to make sure any problems can be solved remotely, to reduce maintenance. 
3. SPI program written yesterday resulted in strange behavior that prevented it from connecting to the cloud. Hitting reset or power cycling reconnected it, but it only lasted for a few seconds before losing the connection. Had to go into safe mode and load older version of program to fix it. SPI works on an Arduino, though.
